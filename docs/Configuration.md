Configuration is divided into multiple files, below is out-lined the most basic usage of each.

## [[config.yml]]
This holds the primary configuration for uSkyBlock, i.e. the *world*, the *size* of islands, etc.

## [[challenges.yml]]
This file holds all the challenges (and ranks) available to the users.

## [[levelConfig.yml]]
This file holds all the block-values (how much should each block influence your island score), as
well as various ways to limit, or cross-reference blocks.

**Note:** the `levelConfig.yml` is quite advanced, and should not be edited unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing.
