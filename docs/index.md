### What is uSkyblock

uSkyblock is a surviving game that transport you to a small island in mid-air. You need to try and survive with the minimum resources. <br>
You can with the few given items create a cobblestone generator which you can then use to expand your island. <br>
By doing the challenges (command **/challenges** or **/c**) you can earn Items, Money, XP and Special permissions. Some of these items you earn are needed to complete the next challenges. <br>
You can play alone or you can invite your friends to build together on your island. <br>
You can set a warp (**/is warp [playername]** to show off what you have done on your island. This can be turned on or off at the GUI.<br>
You can set your own biome (**/is biome [biomename]**).<br>

### How to post an issue

Posting an issue is for us a way to communicate with our users.<br>
All these issue's are taken seriously and checked over and over and then tested again. Due to all different kinds of environments this is a very consuming task for us and we like to ask you to include some information to make our work a bit easier.
To assess these issue's we need the following basic information to start with:
* server version (Craftbukkit/Spigot)
* uSkyblock version
* WorldEdit version
* WorldGuard version
* Vault
* Multiverse-Core

Optional: The startup log
* When posting log files we would recommend using [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) (it's free) to keep the forums a bit clear from long posts.

To make everybody's life easier we added the command **/usb version** (from version v2.2-HF1) which will give you all the info we need to start with.<br>
Please do not use the words **"I use/got the latest version"** as this aint telling us anything.
